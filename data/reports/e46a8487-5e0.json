    "composure_reasoning": "Witness showed multiple stress indicators including [sigh] (3 times), [nervous laugh], [nervous], and frequent [throat_clear] and [pause] tags, especially when confronted with Exhibit E. Lost composure completely when cornered about the email contradiction.",
    "tactical_discipline_reasoning": "Witness fell into every trap - over-explained when asked simple yes/no questions, volunteered damaging information about 'many factors' and 'personal issues' when not asked, and failed to maintain silence during strategic pauses, instead filling dead air with rambling justifications.",
    "professionalism_reasoning": "Generally maintained respectful tone but displayed [nervous laugh] when reading his own email, showed defensive behavior with phrases like 'incomplete characterization,' and became argumentative when trying to deflect responsibility to external factors.",
    "directness_reasoning": "Initially evasive on enforcement responsibility question, required multiple attempts to get straight answers, gave one clear 'No' at the end but only after extensive evasion and deflection throughout the session.",
    "consistency_reasoning": "Major contradiction exposed between January 5 email stating 'dangerously short' and later testimony claiming 'adequate staffing' - attempted weak rationalization about 'context' and 'managing' but could not reconcile the fundamental inconsistency in his statements."

    "trial_risk": "The jury will see him laughing nervously while reading his own words about 'dangerous' understaffing, then watch him squirm when confronted with his contradictory testimony - this destroys his credibility as the safety supervisor who knew of the danger but did nothing."
