Agent Response:
{
  "isObjectionable": true,
  "category": "HEARSAY",
  "freRule": "FRE 803(4) - Statement Made for Medical Diagnosis or Treatment",
  "explanation": "The deposition question asks what the doctor told the witness about their condition. This is likely a hearsay statement by the doctor, which would be admissible under FRE 803(4) if made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment. However, the question does not provide enough information to determine if the statement meets the requirements of this exception, such as being reasonably pertinent to medical diagnosis or treatment. Therefore, this question is potentially objectionable on hearsay grounds.",
  "confidence": 4
