# Increment Sizes

## Overview

True Market's TrueX (the "Exchange") enforces minimum increments for all instruments traded on the Exchange. Any order submitted with a quote price or size outside the defined bucket ranges will be rejected.

- **Bucket**: Represents the pricing tier or category for a specific range of prices.
- **Lower Price ($)**: The minimum price for the bucket, expressed in the quoting asset of the instrument pair.
- **Upper Price ($)**: The maximum price for the bucket, expressed in the quoting asset of the instrument pair. In some cases, it may indicate no upper bound (e.g., ∞).
- **Tick Size ($) - Quote Increment**: The smallest allowable change in the quoted price within the bucket.
- **Lot Size - Base Increment**: The minimum quantity change for the base asset that can be transacted in the bucket.
- **Minimum Tradable Notional**: The minimum notional of an instrument that can be traded, set by the exchange.
