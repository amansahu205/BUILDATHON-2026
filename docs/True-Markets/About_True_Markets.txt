# About True Markets

**True Markets** is building the future of digital asset trading through a unified platform that bridges centralized and decentralized finance.

## TrueX: CeFi Exchange

[**TrueX**](/documentation/exchange/truex) is our centralized exchange (CeFi) built for institutional-grade speed, reliability, and compliance. It offers:

- High-performance trading infrastructure
- Secure custody through a qualified custodian
- FIX, REST, and WebSocket APIs for market data, order entry, and account management


## DeFi Gateway

[**DeFi Gateway**](/apis/defi/v2026_01_14) brings non-custodial, smart contract-based trading to True Markets. Users are able to:

- Trade directly from their wallets
- Maintain full control of their assets
- Interact with open, verifiable protocols


**Both CeFi and DeFi systems are API-first**, with robust documentation and developer tools to support programmatic access to markets.
