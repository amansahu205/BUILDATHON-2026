## 21. Get Liquidity data of a Liquidity Pool or Token

There are multiple onchain endpoints that provide the liquidity data (`reserve_in_usd`) of a pool, for example: [Specific Pool Data by Pool Address](/reference/pool-address). You may also get liquidity data (`total_reserve_in_usd`) of a token, using endpoints like: [Token Data by Token Address](/reference/token-data-contract-address).

Note: `reserve_in_usd` (pool) represents the total liquidity of all tokens within a specific pool, whereas `total_reserve_in_usd` (token) refers to the total liquidity portion attributable to a specific token across all available pools.

## 22. Get list of onchain DEX pools based on specific criteria

* Use [/pools/megafilter](/reference/pools-megafilter) to retrieve data for onchain DEX pools that match a given set of filters.

* Example of use cases:

  * Custom filtering: Combine multiple params — like liquidity thresholds, FDV ranges, 24-hour volume, and more — to extract the precise datasets you need.
  * Risk and Quality checks: Apply fraud filters to weed out risky projects.

* For more details on examples and available filters, refer to:

  * [Changelog — New Megafilter Endpoint](/changelog#february-2025)

    (includes all wallet types: CEX, treasury/issuer, etc.)
  * Mint and Freeze Authority

## 25. Get Latest Token/Pool Data from Launchpad

* Use [megafilter](/reference/pools-megafilter) endpoint to retrieve latest launchpad data, by flagging `sort=pool_created_at_desc`. Learn more on [changelog](/changelog#now-supported%3A-launchpad-data-pump-fun-%26-more-%2C-granular-ohlcv%2C-and-honeypot-info).
* **Request example (Get latest pools on Pump.fun)**:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash theme={null}

  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 26. Get Latest Price/Data for Tokens Not Actively Traded

* When a token has no active pools (no valid swaps in the past 7 days), you can still retrieve the latest available price and data by using the `include_inactive_source=true` parameter.

* This parameter sources data from the pool with the most recent swap, regardless of how long ago it occurred.

* The `last_trade_timestamp` field in the response indicates when the most recent trade took place.

* Supported endpoints:

  * [Token Data by Token Address](/reference/token-data-contract-address) — `/onchain/networks/../tokens/..`
  * [Tokens Data by Token Addresses](/reference/tokens-data-contract-addresses) — `/onchain/networks/../tokens/multi/..`
  * [Top Pools by Token Address](/reference/top-pools-contract-address) — `/onchain/networks/../tokens/../pools`
