==============================================================
1. PRODUCT VISION & PROBLEM STATEMENT
==============================================================

VERDICT is a B2B SaaS platform sold exclusively to law firms. It
reduces witness deposition preparation time from 16 hours to 6
hours per witness using four coordinated AI agents.

THE PROBLEM:
Law firms preparing witnesses for depositions spend 60%+ of prep
time manually reviewing prior statements, anticipating opposing
counsel tactics, and coaching witnesses on composure and
consistency. There is no software that simulates the actual
psychological and evidentiary pressure of a live deposition.

THE SOLUTION:
VERDICT creates AI-simulated deposition sessions in which a
voice AI acts as opposing counsel ("Interrogator"), a real-time
legal analysis engine flags objectionable questions ("Objection
Copilot"), a contradiction scorer catches witness inconsistencies
against their prior sworn statements ("Inconsistency Detector"),
and a coaching AI synthesizes a structured brief at session end
("Review Orchestrator").

TAGLINE: AI-powered deposition coaching. From 16 hours to 6.

PRICING MODEL: B2B SaaS. Sold to law firms, not individuals.
No consumer signup flow. No public SEO landing pages inside the
app (marketing site at trueverdict.com is separate).

==============================================================
2. TARGET USERS & B2B CONTEXT
==============================================================

PRIMARY USER: Litigation attorneys at midsize law firms.
  - Partners and Associates running witness prep
  - Managing 3-15 witnesses per active case
  - Billable hours consumed by manual prep = $800-$1,500/hr

SECONDARY USER: Witnesses (defendants, plaintiffs, experts)
  - Access via time-limited token link (no firm account needed)
  - Simple voice-only interface with one button

FIRM ADMIN: IT Director / Managing Partner
  - Provisions seats, configures SSO, manages data retention

NOT a consumer product. No B2C users. No individual signups.
Enterprise-only identity: firm SSO (SAML 2.0 / Okta) or
email+password provisioned by firm admin.

==============================================================
5. P0.1 — INTERROGATOR AGENT (ElevenLabs Conversational AI)
==============================================================

PURPOSE:
AI simulates opposing counsel, asking legally-accurate deposition
questions in a natural voice. The Interrogator adapts in real
time based on witness hesitation, detected inconsistencies, and
prior session performance.

VOICE PROFILE:
  Voice: "Adam" (ElevenLabs) — authoritative, measured cadence
  Model: eleven_turbo_v2_5
  Latency target: < 2s from question generation to audio start

ARCHITECTURE:
  Session start:
    build_system_prompt(case)
      -> case type, witness role, focus areas, extracted facts,
         prior statements, exhibit list, aggression level, and
         5-dimension scoring rubric (see below)
      -> behavioral audio tags injected into prompt:
         [pause], [sigh], [nervous laugh], [throat_clear]
    get_conversation_token(agent_id)
      -> ElevenLabs signed WebSocket URL for this session
    build_conversation_override(system_prompt, first_message)
      -> Per-session config override (prevents race conditions
         from mutating shared agent configuration)

  Question generation (per turn):
    search_prior_statements(case_id, prior_answer, top_k=3)
      -> Databricks prior_statements_index (filtered by case_id)
      -> Retrieved prior statements injected into question prompt
    claude_stream(system_prompt, user_message, max_tokens=200)
      -> Streaming question chunks via SSE
    text_to_speech(question_text, INTERROGATOR_VOICE_ID)
      -> ElevenLabs TTS -> audio bytes -> base64 to frontend

ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR:
  Standard:       Open -> specific -> challenge (per topic arc)
  Hesitation:     IF witness silence > 4s
                  THEN sharper follow-up ("Let me ask that
                  differently, Doctor...")
  Sentinel:       IF Fear/Contempt detected >= 0.8s (P1.4)
                  THEN selects high-pressure follow-up for topic
  Inconsistency:  IF Detector fires on current topic
                  THEN Interrogator extends questioning before
                  moving to next topic
  Session 2+:     Prior weak areas (axes < 60) pre-briefed;
                  persisting inconsistency flags injected;
                  prior question log prevents exact repetition

AGGRESSION LEVELS:
  STANDARD:     Ask methodically. Allow witness to elaborate.
  ELEVATED:     Press on contradictions. Use controlled silence.
  HIGH_STAKES:  Maximum pressure. Expose inconsistencies directly.

FOCUS AREAS (multi-select):
  - Timeline & Chronology
  - Financial Details
  - Communications & Correspondence
  - Relationships & Key Parties
  - Actions Taken
  - Prior Sworn Statements

5-DIMENSION SCORING RUBRIC (built into system prompt):
  1. Composure (Calm under pressure)
     High: Absorbs aggressive questioning without vocal changes
     Penalty: [sigh], [nervous], defensiveness on confrontation
  2. Tactical Discipline (Handling Silence & Traps)
     High: Short answers; silent when Interrogator uses silence
     Penalty: Over-explaining, filling dead air, volunteering info
  3. Professionalism (Courtroom demeanor)
     High: Respectful, neutral, objective
     Penalty: [laugh], [scoff], sarcasm, arguing
  4. Directness (Evasion tracking)
     High: Concise answers ("Yes", "No", "I do not recall")
     Penalty: "I don't recall" > twice on same topic, forcing
     Interrogator to repeat
  5. Consistency (Endurance over time)
     High: Same narrative and tone throughout
     Penalty: Contradicting prior statement, tone shift on focus areas

SSE ENDPOINT: POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/agents/question
  Request body: { questionNumber, currentTopic, priorAnswer,
                  hesitationDetected, recentInconsistencyFlag }
  SSE events: QUESTION_START -> QUESTION_CHUNK (streaming)
           -> QUESTION_AUDIO (base64) -> QUESTION_END
  Latency: first chunk < 2s; full question < 4s

==============================================================
6. P0.2 — OBJECTION COPILOT (Databricks FRE Vector Search)
==============================================================

PURPOSE:
Analyzes each Interrogator question for objectionable content
under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE). Fires alert to
attorney's live rail within 1.5s of question delivery.

DATABRICKS VECTOR SEARCH:
  Index: verdict.sessions.fre_rules_index
  Endpoint: verdict-vector-endpoint (STANDARD, Direct Access)
  Embedding: databricks-gte-large-en (1024 dimensions)
  Source: Official uscode.house.gov USLM XML (Rules 101-1103,
          all 11 Articles), current through Public Law 119-73
          (January 2026)
  Two chunk types per rule: rule text + Advisory Committee Notes
  Filter: is_deposition_relevant = true at query time
  One-time setup: scripts/setup_databricks.py (creates endpoint
                  + both indexes)
  One-time ingest: scripts/fre_xml_ingestion.py (parses USLM
                   XML, generates 1024d embeddings, upserts)

FLOW (fires in parallel with question delivery, <= 1.5s):
  search_fre_rules(question_text, top_k=3, deposition_only=True)
    -> Databricks fre_rules_index
    -> Top 3 FRE rules + Advisory Committee Notes
  claude_chat(OBJECTION_SYSTEM, prompt_with_fre_context)
    -> Structured JSON: { isObjectionable, freRule, category,
                          explanation, confidence }
  IF isObjectionable: fire alert in attorney rail
  IF not: silent pass (no UI noise)

OBJECTION CATEGORIES:
  LEADING            FRE 611(c)   Suggests a specific answer
  HEARSAY            FRE 801      Out-of-court statement for truth
  COMPOUND           (none)       Multiple questions embedded
  ASSUMES_FACTS      (none)       Presupposes unestablished facts
  SPECULATION        (none)       Asks witness to guess

ATTORNEY RAIL ALERT:
  Card: category badge + FRE rule + plain-English explanation
  Example: "LEADING — FRE 611(c) | Q7 | 00:14:22
            Question suggests a specific answer. Witness should
            pause before answering."
  Actions: [Mark Coached] [Dismiss]
  Optional soft audio chime (attorney-configurable)

REST ENDPOINT: POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/agents/objection
  Request body: { questionNumber, questionText, questionTimestamp }
  Response: { isObjectionable, freRule, category, explanation,
              confidence, processingMs }
  processingMs MUST be <= 1500 to meet P0 acceptance criteria

FALLBACK (Databricks unavailable):
  Rail badge: "FRE corpus offline — Objection Copilot
               running Claude-only"
  Claude handles FRE classification from its training knowledge
  Session continues uninterrupted

==============================================================
7. P0.3 — INCONSISTENCY DETECTOR (Nemotron + Databricks)
==============================================================

PURPOSE:
After each witness answer, retrieves semantically similar prior
sworn statements from Databricks and sends them with the current
answer to Nemotron for contradiction scoring. Fires live alert
at >= 0.75 confidence within 4s.

DATABRICKS VECTOR SEARCH:
  Index: verdict.sessions.prior_statements_index
  Endpoint: verdict-vector-endpoint (same STANDARD endpoint)
  Embedding: databricks-gte-large-en (1024 dimensions)
  Filter: case_id = <case_id>  (firm-level isolation guaranteed
          by ingestion pipeline calling upsert_prior_statement)
  Schema: { id, case_id, content, page, line, doc_type,
            witness_name, document_id, embedding }

NEMOTRON API:
  Model: nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1
  Base URL: https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1
  Client: httpx (no official Python SDK)
  Budget: $40+ API credits from hackathon organizers
  Timeout: 5 seconds (see fallback section)
  Output: { contradiction_confidence: float 0-1,
            best_match_index: int, reasoning: str }

FLOW (fires <= 4s after witness answer):
  search_prior_statements(case_id, answer_text, top_k=5)
    -> Databricks prior_statements_index (filtered by case_id)
    -> Top 5 semantically similar prior sworn statements
  score_contradiction(answer, prior_statements, case_context)
    -> Nemotron API -> contradiction_confidence (0-1)
    -> best_match_index -> identifies the most contradicted stmt

CONFIDENCE ROUTING:
  >= 0.75  -> LIVE ALERT fired in attorney rail (<= 4s)
               impeachmentRisk = "CONTRADICTION"
               IF Behavioral Sentinel active AND Fear/Contempt
               for >= 0.8s during same answer:
                 impeachmentRisk = "HIGH IMPEACHMENT RISK"
                 confidence += 0.05 (behavioral corroboration)
  0.50-0.74 -> SECONDARY REVIEW QUEUE
               Surfaced in coaching brief only, NOT live rail
               Label: "Possible Inconsistencies — Attorney Review"
  < 0.50   -> DISCARDED silently

LIVE RAIL ALERT FORMAT:
  Card: "CONTRADICTION | Q8 | 00:15:03 | Confidence: 0.91
         Prior: 'The dosage was exactly $217.' — p.47, line 12
         Now:   'approximately $200 range'"
  Actions: [Confirm] [Reject] [Annotate]

FALLBACK (Nemotron > 5s or error):
  Claude-only scoring with raised threshold: 0.75 -> 0.85
  Rail badge: "Scoring: Claude-only mode (Nemotron unavailable)"
  Session continues uninterrupted

REST ENDPOINT: POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/agents/inconsistency
  Request body: { questionText, answerText }
  Response: { flagFound, isLiveFired, contradictionConfidence,
              priorQuote, priorDocumentPage, priorDocumentLine,
              impeachmentRisk }

==============================================================
8. P0.4 — CASE FILE INGESTION PIPELINE
==============================================================

PURPOSE:
Attorneys upload case documents (prior depositions, medical
records, contracts, exhibits). The pipeline extracts text,
runs Claude fact extraction, and upserts statements into
Databricks Vector Search so the Inconsistency Detector has
per-case prior sworn statements to query at session time.

SUPPORTED FORMATS: PDF (text-searchable), DOCX, TXT
MAX SIZE: 200MB per file | 2GB per case
DUPLICATE DETECTION: SHA-256 file hash checked on upload

PIPELINE STAGES:
  1. Browser -> S3 presigned PUT URL (direct upload, bypasses API)
     boto3 generate_presigned_upload() in app/services/s3.py
  2. Backend confirms upload; updates Document status: UPLOADING
  3. Text extraction:
     PDF: pdfplumber (catches image-only PDFs early, error state)
     DOCX: python-docx (paragraphs + table cells)
     Status: INDEXING
  4. Claude fact extraction (claude-sonnet-4-20250514):
     Extracts: parties, key dates, disputed facts, priorStatements
     Result stored in Document.extracted_facts (JSONB column)
  5. Databricks embedding + upsert:
     upsert_prior_statement(case_id, document_id, content,
                            page, line, doc_type, witness_name)
     -> databricks-gte-large-en (1024d) embedding generated
     -> Upserted to verdict.sessions.prior_statements_index
     Document.databricks_doc_id stored post-indexing
  6. Status: READY
     Attorney notified via in-app notification + email

INGESTION STATUS PROGRESSION:
  PENDING -> UPLOADING -> INDEXING -> READY (or FAILED)

FACT REVIEW UI (/cases/:caseId/documents/facts):
  Four sections:
    - Parties (table: name, role, [Edit] inline)
    - Key Dates (table: date, event, source doc + page, [Edit])
    - Disputed Facts (highlighted list, [Edit] per item)
    - Prior Sworn Statements (searchable, page/line refs)
  Attorney confirms each section ([Mark as Confirmed] checkbox)
  CTA "CASE IS READY — ADD WITNESS" unlocks when all confirmed

ERROR STATES:
  File too large:    "File is 312MB — max is 200MB."
  Image-only PDF:    "No text content found. PDF may be
                      image-only. Use text-searchable PDFs."
  Ingestion timeout: "> 5 min — [Proceed with partial index]
                      [Keep waiting]"
  Duplicate upload:  "This document looks identical to [name].
                      Add anyway?"

==============================================================
9. P0.5 — COACHING BRIEF & REVIEW ORCHESTRATOR
==============================================================

PURPOSE:
At session end, generates a comprehensive structured coaching
brief in <= 3 minutes. The brief includes a session score,
5-axis Weakness Map, inconsistency log, objection log, and
top 3 coaching recommendations. An ElevenLabs Coach voice
narrates the key moments.

BRIEF GENERATION PIPELINE:
  1. generate_rule_based_report(transcript, events, case)
     -> Rule-based heuristic scorer in app/services/report_generator.py
     -> Aggression scoring via app/services/aggression.py
        (score_witness(), score_vulnerability())
  2. claude_chat(ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM, session_summary_prompt)
     -> Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514, max_tokens=1500
     -> Returns JSON: { sessionScore, consistencyRate,
                        topRecommendations, narrativeText,
                        weaknessMapScores { composure,
                        tactical_discipline, professionalism,
                        directness, consistency },
                        confirmedFlags, objectionCount,
                        composureAlerts }
  3. ElevenLabs Coach narration:
     Voice: "Rachel" — warm, professional, encouraging
     text_to_speech(narration, ELEVENLABS_COACH_VOICE_ID)
     Narrates: session summary + each high-risk moment + top 3 recs
     Auto-plays on brief load; [Pause] [Skip] [Replay] controls
  4. PDF generation (server-side, headless):
     matplotlib -> 5-axis radar chart PNG
     reportlab -> structured PDF with embedded radar chart
     PDF stored in S3; pdfS3Key saved to Brief record
  5. Brief saved to PostgreSQL -> brief_id returned -> email sent

BRIEF SECTIONS:
  Score Summary Card:
    Session Score: 0-100
    Color: red < 50, amber 50-74, green >= 75
    Delta vs. Session 1 (multi-session only): Δ +17
    Consistency Rate: float (e.g., 0.73 = 73%)
    Alert totals: Objections | Confirmed Inconsistencies | Composure

  Inconsistencies Section:
    Each confirmed flag (expanded by default):
      - Exchange timestamp + [Play clip] (ElevenLabs audio)
      - Current answer with problematic phrase highlighted
      - Prior statement: exact quote + p.XX, line YY
      - Contradiction confidence (e.g., 0.91)
      - Impeachment risk badge: HIGH / CONTRADICTION

  Objections Section:
    Each event: timestamp, question text, FRE rule, category
    Training note for each event
    Objection rate: "4 objectionable questions — witness paused on 1"

  Weakness Map (P1.2 — Radar Chart):
    5 axes: Composure, Tactical Discipline, Professionalism,
            Directness, Consistency
    Each axis: 0-100 (rule-based heuristic + Claude coaching brief)
    Recharts RadarChart in frontend
    Click axis -> drill into lowest-scoring exchanges

  Top 3 Coaching Recommendations:
    "1. Address the $200 vs $217 dosage discrepancy — prepare
        a precise explanation."
    "2. Practice a 3-second pause before answering any leading
        question."
    "3. Focus next session on Financial Details (weakest: 34/100)."

SHARE TOKEN:
  Attorney can share brief with witness via 7-day expiring link
  shareToken stored in Brief record (nanoid, 24 chars)
  GET /api/v1/briefs/share/{share_token} — no auth required
  Witness sees: score, top 3 recommendations ONLY
  Witness DOES NOT see: raw confidence scores, full alert log,
                          attorney annotations

PDF EXPORT: [Download PDF] -> presigned S3 GET URL
ANNOTATION: [Annotate Brief] -> inline comment mode for attorney
NEXT SESSION: [Schedule Next Session] -> /session/new for witness

REST ENDPOINTS:

==============================================================
10. P1 FEATURES (BUILD IF AHEAD OF SCHEDULE)
==============================================================

P1.1 — MULTI-SESSION WITNESS PROFILE
  Witness Profile (/cases/:caseId/witnesses/:witnessId):
    Score trend chart: Session 1 (44) -> Session 2 (61) -> ...
    Improvement delta: "+35 pts from Session 1"
    Plateau alert: "Score unchanged over 3 sessions"
    Weakness Evolution: radar chart Session 1 vs. Latest
    Inconsistency Log: Resolved / Persisting / New status
    Session History: list with scores and [View Brief] links

  Session 2+ adaptive behavior:
    Interrogator receives prior_weak_areas (axes < 60)
    Persisting flags auto-injected into Interrogator pre-briefing
    Aggression: recommend +1 level if prior score < 65
    Brief: auto-includes delta vs. Session 1

  Plateau detection (3+ sessions, no improvement):
    Dashboard banner, profile banner, special brief section
    Email alert to owning attorney

P1.2 — WEAKNESS MAP RADAR (RECHARTS)
  5-axis radar chart rendered by Recharts RadarChart
  Session 1 vs. Latest side-by-side (Witness Profile page)
  Click axis -> lowest-scoring exchanges for that dimension
  Animated: axes animate outward from center on reveal

P1.3 — ARGUMENT STRENGTH SCORING
  Uses Nemotron to score the quality of opposing counsel arguments
  Disabled if Nemotron unavailable: noted in brief
  POST-hackathon refinement

P1.4 — BEHAVIORAL SENTINEL (EXPERIMENTAL)
  Client-side only: MediaPipe Tasks Vision (@mediapipe/tasks-vision
  v0.10.20) runs in WebAssembly in witness browser
  Model: face_landmarker.task (430 landmark points, >= 15 fps)
  FACS Action Units computed client-side:
    AU4  = brow furrow
    AU6  = cheek raise
    AU12 = lip corner pull
    AU20 = lip stretch
    AU45 = blink
  ONLY AU numeric vectors transmitted to backend (never raw video
  or video frames — privacy by design)
  Nemotron processes: FACS AU vectors + text transcript
    simultaneously for multimodal reasoning
  Confidence boost: if Fear/Contempt during inconsistency answer
    -> impeachmentRisk = "HIGH IMPEACHMENT RISK"
    -> confidence += 0.05

  ACTIVATION GATE (firm-level):
    firm.behavioral_sentinel_enabled = false:
      Feature hidden entirely, camera permission NEVER requested
    firm.behavioral_sentinel_enabled = true:
      Toggle visible in session config — OFF by default
      Attorney must explicitly enable per session
    session.sentinel_opted_in = true:
      Witness consent screen: "VERDICT may analyze facial
      expressions to provide composure coaching. No video is
      recorded or transmitted. Analysis runs on your device only."
    Witness denies camera permission:
      Silent degradation; session continues without facial analysis
      Attorney notified; witness sees no indication it was attempted

  RAIL ALERT (if active):
    "COMPOSURE ALERT | Q8 | 00:15:01 | Experimental
     Fear micro-expression (AU4+AU20) 1.2s — gaze aversion
     Inconsistency flag upgraded: HIGH IMPEACHMENT RISK"
    Actions: [Noted] [Disable for session]

                         verdict-backend/data/verdict_cases.json

==============================================================
13. APPLICATION FLOW & USER EXPERIENCE
==============================================================

ENTRY POINTS:
  verdict.law/                  B2B Landing (public)
  verdict.law/login             Login (public)
  verdict.law/onboarding        Firm Setup (public + firm token)
  verdict.law/dashboard         Attorney Dashboard (auth required)
  verdict.law/cases             Case List (auth)
  verdict.law/cases/:id         Case Detail (auth, case owner)
  verdict.law/cases/:id/session/:sid/live  Live Session (auth)

  verdict.law/briefs/:id        Coaching Brief (auth or share token)
  verdict.law/admin             Firm Admin Panel (auth + admin role)

CORE USER FLOWS:

  Flow 1 — Firm Onboarding (one-time, admin):
    Step 1: Activation email -> /onboarding?token= (72hr TTL)
    Step 2: Firm Configuration (Firm Name, SSO or email/password)
    Step 3: Seat Provisioning (CSV upload or manual: Name+Email+Role)
    Step 4: Security Settings (retention, Behavioral Sentinel toggle)
    -> Firm record created in DB; attorneys can create cases

  Flow 2 — Case Creation & Document Ingestion:
    New Case form: name, type, opposing firm, deposition date
    Upload documents: PDF/DOCX/TXT via drag-and-drop (or [Browse])
    Per-document ingestion progress cards (PENDING->UPLOADING->INDEXING->READY)
    Fact Review: confirm parties, dates, disputed facts, prior statements
    "CASE IS READY — ADD WITNESS" CTA unlocks on confirmation

  Flow 3 — Session Configuration:
    Add witness: name, role, email, link to uploaded docs, notes
    Configure session: duration, focus areas (chips), aggression
    level, Objection Copilot ON/OFF, Behavioral Sentinel ON/OFF
    [Generate Practice Link] -> creates 72hr witness token URL
    [Start Session as Attorney] -> attorney solo mode

  Flow 4 — Live Deposition Session:
    Session Lobby (/session/:id/lobby):
      Witness connection status, feature toggle confirmation
      [Begin Session] (active when witness connected or solo)

    Active Session — Attorney View (/session/:id/live):
      THREE-PANEL LAYOUT (desktop, >= 1024px):
        LEFT   (220px):  Timer, current topic, Q# of ~18, controls
        CENTER (flex):   Auto-scrolling transcript (speaker-tagged)
        RIGHT  (320px):  Live Alert Rail (Objection + Inconsistency
                         + Behavioral Sentinel lanes)
      Bottom bar: [Add Note] (timestamped annotation)
      Controls: [Pause] [Skip Topic] [End Session Early]

    Active Session — Witness View (/witness/session/:id):
      Token-gated, no firm login required
      Minimal UI: Opposing Counsel avatar + ElevenLabs waveform
      "Your Turn" mic indicator after question ends
      Session timer
      [Need a Moment] button (pauses, notifies attorney)
      NOT shown: alerts, transcript, score, attorney annotations

    Session Pause (either party):
      Timer: blue -> amber
      Transcript: semi-transparent "Session paused" overlay
      Alert rail: grey overlay "Monitoring paused"

  Flow 5 — Coaching Brief Review:
    Post-session generation progress: 4 animated steps (~2-3 min)
    Brief Viewer (/briefs/:briefId):
      Score Summary Card + Delta vs Session 1
      ElevenLabs Coach auto-plays narration (Rachel voice)
      Inconsistency Section + Objections Section
      Weakness Map radar chart (Recharts)
      Top 3 Recommendations
      Actions: [Download PDF] [Share with Witness] [Annotate] [Schedule Next Session]

  Flow 6 — Multi-Session Progress (P1.1):
    Witness Profile (/cases/:id/witnesses/:witnessId):
      Score trend chart across all sessions
      Weakness Evolution: radar Session 1 vs. Latest
      Inconsistency Log: Resolved / Persisting / New
      Session History list with scores and [View Brief]
      Plateau alert if score unchanged across 3 sessions

RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR:
  Mobile (< 768px):
    Primary use case: WITNESS view (optimized for iOS Safari,
    Android Chrome — full-screen avatar + large "Your Turn" button)
    Attorney views on mobile: degraded read-only tasks only
    Live Session on mobile: NOT recommended (alert rail collapses
    to notification badge with [Show Alerts] FAB -> bottom sheet)

  Tablet (768-1024px):
    Alert rail collapses to 240px; collapse toggle available
    Single-column brief, radar chart full-width

  Desktop (>= 1024px) — PRIMARY EXPERIENCE:
    Three-panel live session layout
    Two-column brief viewer (score/summary left, detail right)
    Keyboard shortcuts:
      Space    = pause / resume session
      Cmd+N    = add timestamped note
      Esc      = close modals
      Cmd+E    = end session (with confirmation dialog)
    Minimum recommended resolution: 1280 x 768

15. ERROR HANDLING & GRACEFUL DEGRADATION
==============================================================

SERVICE DEGRADATION CHAINS:
  Nemotron down (> 5s timeout or error):
    -> Inconsistency Detector: Claude-only, threshold 0.75 -> 0.85
    -> Argument Strength Scoring (P1.3): disabled for session
    Rail badge: "Scoring: Claude-only mode (Nemotron unavailable)"

  ElevenLabs TTS down:
    -> Questions render as text cards in center transcript
    Banner: "Audio paused — questions displayed as text"
    -> Witness view: large centered text replaces voice

  ElevenLabs STT down:
    -> Browser Web Speech API fallback (lower accuracy)
    Banner: "Voice recognition in fallback mode"

  Both TTS and STT down:
    -> Full text-only mode
    Banner: "Text-only mode active — voice services unavailable"
    Attorney types/selects questions; witness types answers

    -> Inconsistency Detector: returns empty (no prior statements)

SESSION DATA PROTECTION:
  All session events persisted to Redis every 60 seconds
  Maximum data loss on any failure: 60 seconds of session events
  Browser offline: events buffered in IndexedDB; flushed on reconnect
  Persistent top banner: "Connection lost — session data being saved"

JWT EXPIRY DURING SESSION:
  5-minute warning: non-dismissable modal -> [Extend]
  Silent re-auth via SSO or password re-entry
  Session data: all events already persisted, zero data loss

HTTP ERROR STATES:
  404: "Page not found" or "Case not found" + [Return to Dashboard]
  403: "You don't have permission to access this case."
  500 (transient): Toast "Something went wrong. [Retry]"
