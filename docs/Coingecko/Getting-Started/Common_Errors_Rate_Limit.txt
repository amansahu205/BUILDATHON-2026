# Common Errors & Rate Limit

## Common Errors

The server responds to a user's request by issuing status codes when the request is made to the server. Kindly refer to the table below to further understand the status codes when indicating the success or failure of an API call.

| Status Codes                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400` (Bad Request)           | This is due to an invalid request and the server could not process the user's request                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `401` (Unauthorized)          | This is due to the lack of valid authentication credentials for the requested resource by the user                                                                                                                                                            |
| `403` (Forbidden)             | This is likely indicating that your access is blocked by our server, and we're unable to authorize your request                                                                                                                                               |
| `408` (Timeout)               | This error indicates that our server did not receive your complete request within our allowed time frame. This is usually caused by a slow network connection on your end or network latency. Please check your connection and try sending the request again. |
| `429` (Too many requests)     | This is likely indicating that the rate limit has reached. The user should reduce the number of calls made, or consider scaling their service plan that has much higher rate limits and call credits                                                          |
| `500` (Internal Server Error) | This is a generic error response indicating that the server has encountered an unexpected issue that prevented it from fulfilling the request                                                                                                                 |

## Rate Limit

<Note>
  ### **Notes**

  * If you're using the Public API with Google Sheet and got hit with error, this is due to the IP sharing among Google Sheet users, and we have no control over this.
  * If you need reliable performance, please **register for a demo account** or **subscribe to a paid plan** that comes with dedicated infra (API key) to prevent rate limit issues.
  * For more details, please go to the page [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing).
</Note>

* For Public API user (Demo plan), the rate limit is \~30 calls per minutes and it varies depending on the traffic size.
* If you're Pro API user (any paid plan), the rate limit is depending on the paid plan that you're subscribed to.
* Regardless of the HTTP status code returned (including `4xx` and `5xx` errors), all API requests will count towards your **minute rate limit**.
