  * Minimum Order Value
    * The Exchange reserves the right, at its sole and absolute discretion, to determine, impose, and amend from time to time the minimum order value applicable to any order submitted on The Exchange. The minimum notional value shall represent the minimum monetary amount required for order acceptance, calculated as the product of the order’s price and quantity.
    * All orders submitted to The Exchange shall be subject to the prevailing minimum notional value requirement in effect at the time of submission. Orders that do not meet the applicable minimum notional value may, at The Exchange’s discretion, be rejected, canceled, or otherwise not accepted for execution.

The Exchange shall bear no liability for any loss, delay, or inconvenience arising from the rejection, cancellation, or non-acceptance of any order that fails to comply with this requirement.
    * The determination of compliance with the Minimum Order Value requirement shall vary by order type, as follows:
      * Market Orders
        * The Exchange shall determine the order value using the current best bid or best offer available at the time of submission and the order’s specified quantity. If, based on prevailing market conditions, the calculated order value does not meet the Minimum Order Value threshold, or if insufficient liquidity exists to satisfy the requested size, The Exchange may, at its discretion, reject or cancel the order in whole or in part.
      * Limit Orders
        * The Exchange shall calculate the order value using the limit price specified by the participant multiplied by the order quantity. If the resulting value falls below the Minimum Order Value threshold, The Exchange may reject the order upon submission. Limit Orders modified after acceptance such that their order value no longer meets the requirement may also be subject to automatic cancellation.
      * Value Limit Orders
        * The Exchange shall determine the implied quantity based on the best available price at the time of order creation. If the calculated order value is below the applicable threshold, The Exchange may, at its discretion, reject or adjust the order prior to entry into the matching engine.
    * The Exchange will make reasonable efforts to publish and maintain information regarding the applicable Minimum Order Value thresholds, including any subsequent modifications, through official communication channels, public notices, or the Exchange’s application programming interface (“API”) documentation.
  * Self Trade Prevention
    * The Exchange may establish self trade protection (STP) mechanisms that are defaulted to all order books and are not overridable by the end participant.
      * The Exchange may also establish additional STP mechanisms for specific or individual order books.  These mechanisms are not overridable by end participants.
      * The defaulted self trade protection mechanism applied to all order books shall be as outlined in section 2.10.3.1.
        * The Exchange's default self trade protection mechanism will take precedence over any participant level or order level option supplied. If the default STP mechanism permits participant-level or order-level selections, then order-level selections take precedence over participant-level selections.
        * Each book shall have no self trade prevention enabled by default.
        * Orders may request either no self trade prevention, cancel aggressive or cancel both self trade protections
        * Participants may request either, no self trade prevention, cancel aggressive or cancel both self trade protections.  This will impact all orders entered via any API used to interact with The Exchange by the participant, unless overridden at the order level.
  * Opening Cross
    * The Exchange may establish a mechanism for opening newly listed assets or assets that have previously been halted and are returning to normal trading.
    * The duration of the opening cross will be no shorter than 5 minutes.

        * When an asset enters the opening rotation The Exchange will broadcast a messaging indicating the start of the opening rotation
        * Participants may submit limit orders, order cancels, and order modifications during this time.  All orders entered are subject to The Exchange’s Price Band protections as outlined in section 3.10.2.
        * Participants may NOT submit market orders during the opening cross.
        * During the opening cross The Exchange will publish at specific intervals, messages to participants containing but not limited to: the indicative opening price, the aggregated bid and offer quantities at the indicative opening price, and the current imbalance information
      * Price Determination and Order Matching
        * The opening cross price is the single price that maximizes executable volume and minimizes imbalance, subject to tie-breaking rules:
          * Price that maximizes traded volume.
          * Price that minimizes imbalance.
          * Price closest to the reference price as determined by The Exchange.
        * Limit orders at or better than the opening cross price are executed first.
        * Remaining unexecuted limit orders rest in the order book for continuous trading.
        * Buy orders above the opening price and outside of the opening price bands will be canceled back to the participant. Sell orders below the opening price and outside the opening price bands will be canceled back to the participant.
      * Failure to Determine Price
        * In the event The Exchange is unable to determine an opening price for the asset The Exchange may take one of the following actions:
          * Extend the Opening cross.
          * Default to the opening price to The Exchange’s reference price.

      * Order Parameters
        * Order parameters that modify order behaviors shall be ranked in the following order:
          * Displayed Limit Orders
          * Reserved
        * Order Modifications
          * An order which is modified will maintain its priority as long as the following conditions are met:
            * Modification involves a decrease in the quantity of the order less than or equal to the current requested quantity on the order.
          * An order which is modified will lose its priority if the modification changes the price in any way, increases the quantity requested greater than the current requested quantity, or changes the price type of the original order.
  * Order Execution
    * Orders shall be matched for execution and routed in accordance with the following conditions.
      * Buy Orders

    * The Exchange may also exercise Clawback in the event of clearly erroneous trades, settlement failures, regulatory directives, or extraordinary events beyond the reasonable control of the Exchange that materially impact market integrity or proper settlement.
      * Malicious or Prohibited Conduct. Where a Participant engages in fraud, manipulation, abuse, or other activity in violation of these Rules or applicable law, including conduct intended to disrupt orderly market operations or obtain unfair advantage.
      * Serious Technical or Operational Error. Where a material systems malfunction, operational error, or failure of the Exchange results in executions or positions inconsistent with the intended operation of the market.
      * Clearly Erroneous Transactions. Where trades occur at prices or quantities substantially inconsistent with prevailing market conditions, or where such trades are the result of obvious error in order entry or system processing.
      * Risk Control Violations. Where executions occur in contravention of the Exchange’s risk parameters, including but not limited to credit limits, position limits, kill switches, or other protective controls.
      * Settlement Failures. Where a Participant fails to make or receive payment or delivery as required, and reversal or adjustment is necessary to preserve market integrity.
      * Regulatory or Legal Requirement. Where reversal or adjustment is mandated by applicable law, regulation, court order, or direction of a competent authority.
      * Extraordinary Events. Where circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the Exchange, including but not limited to natural disasters, cyberattacks, or other force majeure events, materially impair the fair and orderly operation of the market.
    * In exercising a Clawback, the Exchange may debit or credit Participant accounts, cancel or amend trades, or otherwise take such actions as it deems necessary to restore a fair and orderly market. Participants acknowledge and agree that the Exchange shall not be liable for any losses, costs, or damages arising from a Clawback undertaken pursuant to this Section, except as may be expressly required by applicable law.
* ### Trading Fees
  * Reference Asset
    * The Exchange will settle all fees in the reference asset.
      * Participants must have an available balance of the reference asset in order to place a buy trade as outlined in section 2.13.1.1 of the Trading Rules.  Participants with insufficient balance will not be able to place orders on The Exchange.
      * Participants do not need to have an available balance of the reference asset in order to place a sell trade as outlined in section. Fees will be deducted from the resulting trade balance.  Participants may therefore be credited or debited an amount less than the gross trade result in an amount equal to the net proceeds after fees.
      * The amount of reference asset held in escrow is calculated as a percentage of the order quantity times the order price. This is known as the fee hold.
      * Market Orders Fee Calculation
        * The amount of reference asset held in escrow for market orders will be calculated on order entry based on the current exchange best bid or best offer.  If the participant does not have enough available balance the market order will be rejected.
    * The Exchange will hold in escrow the worst possible fee outcome for each order placed onto The Exchange.  Should that order execute, The Exchange will calculate the exact fee as outlined in section 4.4 and return any remaining balance to the participant.
  * Fee Schedule Changes
    * The Exchange reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change the fee schedule for any order book at any time.  The Exchange will make a best effort to alert participants to the change before implementing the fee schedule change.
  * Volume Based Fee Discounts
    * Reserved
  * Fee Refunds
    * All fees are non-refundable
    * The Exchange reserves the right to refund fees at its discretion for any reason.
  * Inactivity / Maintenance Fee
    * The Exchange does not charge fees for account inactivity or for account maintenance.
  * Fee Schedule
    * The Exchange fee schedule is published separately from this document.
    * Notice of Changes
      * The Exchange will provide at least 1 day's notice before implementing changes to the fee schedule.  The Exchange will provide, at its best effort, notices to participants regarding the fee schedule changes.
* ### Definitions
  * **Asset -** A crypto or fiat currency supported by The Exchange.
  * **Stablecoin -** A type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reference asset.
  * **Self Trade Protection -** A mechanism implemented by The Exchange to prevent orders placed by the same participant (or beneficial owner) from matching against each other. This helps to stop “self trades,” which can create misleading volume, distort market prices, or potentially be used for manipulative practices.
  * **Cancel Aggressive** - Two orders from the same participant would trade with each other, the incoming (aggressive) order is canceled. This is also known as “cancel newest”.
  * **Cancel Both -** Two orders from the same participant would trade with each other, both the incoming and resting orders are canceled.
  * **Beneficial Ownership -** A person or entity that ultimately owns or controls an asset, such as a company, property, or financial instrument, and benefits from it, even if the asset is held in someone else's name (e.g., through nominees, trusts, or other intermediaries).
  * **Indicative Opening Price** - The potential opening price disseminated during the opening rotation period (IOP).
  * **Opening Rotation** - The period during which orders may be entered, canceled, or modified prior to the auction match.
  * **Opening Cross** - Price at which the asset is opened and orders are executed.  Normal trading follows immediately.
  * **Fee Hold** - Worst case possible fee held by the exchange in escrow.
* ### Appendix A
  * Decentralized Order Ingress
    * This Appendix governs the receipt and execution of orders submitted to the Exchange through decentralized finance (“DeFi”) sources, including but not limited to on-chain wallets, smart contracts, and approved cross-chain bridge mechanisms. These provisions apply in addition to the general Exchange Rules and are binding on all Participants utilizing DeFi ingress channels.
  * Eligibility
    * Each wallet, smart contract, or bridge endpoint used for ingress must be explicitly associated with a verified Participant entity. Association shall be demonstrated through cryptographic proof of ownership or control (e.g., signed messages). Orders submitted from unaffiliated or unverified addresses shall not be accepted. The Exchange reserves the right to suspend or revoke eligibility for any address or contract that fails ongoing verification or monitoring requirements.
  * Order Execution
    * Orders are deemed received when recorded by the Exchange’s secure gateway. Each order shall be time-stamped to the nanosecond and prioritized accordingly. Blockchain mempool timestamps, gas-fee bidding, or network propagation times are not considered for purposes of sequencing or priority on the Exchange.
  * Trading Fees
    * Orders submitted via DeFi ingress shall be subject to the same maker/taker fee schedule as API-sourced orders, unless otherwise published by the Exchange.
    * Aggregators and routers must disclose to their users any fee-sharing or rebate arrangements that affect effective execution costs.
  * Asset Conversion Policy
    * The Exchange designates certain stablecoins as eligible base assets for trading and settlement. Orders submitted via DeFi ingress that reference a non-supported stablecoin, or a digital asset marketed as a stablecoin but not recognized by the Exchange, may be automatically converted into the Exchange’s designated stablecoin at prevailing market rates prior to execution.
    * Conversion shall be conducted through Exchange-approved liquidity pools or market counterparties. The conversion rate applied shall reflect the best available price reasonably obtainable by the Exchange at the time of processing.
    * This policy applies both to order submission and to settlement balances. Assets received in unsupported stablecoins may be converted upon receipt, and proceeds of completed trades may be settled in the designated stablecoin.
    * All conversion events will be reflected in the Participant’s transaction records and account statements.
    * The Exchange assumes no liability for slippage, depegging, or valuation losses associated with conversion of unsupported stablecoins. Participants remain responsible for ensuring that deposits and orders are submitted in recognized formats.
