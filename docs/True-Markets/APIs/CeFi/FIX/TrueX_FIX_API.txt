# TrueX FIX API

## Introduction

TrueX FIX protocol follows the FIX 5.0 SP2 standard which separates the application protocol version (FIX50SP2) from the session protocol version (FIXT.1.1) in the header. The specification provides details on the FIX protocol messages, components, and sessions supported by TrueX. This specification is divided into multiple sections for clarity and ease of reference.

TrueX operates multiple **FIX sessions** tailored for different functionalities:

- **Order Entry** – Used for submitting and managing orders.
- **Market Data** – Used for subscribing to market data feeds.
- **Drop Copy** – Provides a copy of all executions and order events for compliance and reporting purposes.


Each section below contains links to the relevant pages with detailed specifications.
